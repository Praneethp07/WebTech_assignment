    <p style="color:rgb(107, 10, 96); font-size: 2rem;">My trip to Mumbai was one of the most memorable experiences of my life. I visited the city during the monsoon
      season, which added to the beauty and charm of the place. </p>

        <h1>Getting Around</h1>
        <p>One of the things that struck me about Mumbai was the sheer volume of traffic on the roads. The best way to get
          around the city is by taking the local trains. I was amazed at how efficient and well-connected the train
          network is. </p>

        <h1>Food</h1>
        <p>The food in Mumbai is amazing! I tried a lot of local street food and it was all delicious. Some of my
          favorites were vada pav, pav bhaji, and sev puri. I also had some amazing seafood at a restaurant called
          Gajalee. </p>
